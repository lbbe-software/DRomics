\title{Selection of significantly responsive items}

\description{
Significantly responsive items are selected using one of the three proposed methods: 
a quadratic trend test, a linear trend test or an ANOVA-based test.
}

\usage{
itemselect(omicdata, select.method = c("quadratic", "linear", "ANOVA"), 
  FDR = 0.05, max.ties.prop = 0.2)   

\method{print}{itemselect}(x, nfirstitems = 20, \dots)
}

\arguments{
\item{omicdata}{An object of class \code{"microarraydata"}, \code{"RNAseqdata"},
\code{"metabolomicdata"} or \code{"continuousanchoringdata"} respectively returned by 
functions \code{microarraydata}, \code{RNAseqdata}, 
\code{metabolomicdata} or \code{continuousanchoringdata}.}

\item{select.method}{\code{"quadratic"} for a 
quadratic trend test on dose ranks, \code{"linear"} for a linear trend test on dose ranks and \code{"ANOVA"} for 
an ANOVA-type test (see details for further explaination).}

\item{FDR}{The threshold in term of FDR (False Discovery Rate) for selecting responsive items.}

\item{max.ties.prop}{The maximal tolerated proportion of tied values for each item, 
  above which the item cannot be selected (must be in ]0, 0.5], 
  and by default fixed at 0.2 - see details for a description of this filtering step).}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{"itemselect"}.}

\item{nfirstitems}{The maximum number of selected items to print.}

\item{\dots}{ further arguments passed to print function.}
}

\details{
The selection of responsive items is performed using the \code{limma} package
for microarray and continuous omics data (such as metabolomics), the \code{DESeq2} package for
RNAseq data and the \code{lm} function for continuous anchoring data. 
Three methods are proposed (as described below). Within \code{limma} those methods are implemented using functions \code{\link[limma]{lmFit}},  
\code{\link[limma]{eBayes}} and \code{\link[limma]{topTable}} with p-values ajusted for multiple 
testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (also called q-values), with the false discovery rate given in
input (argument \code{FDR}). 
Within \code{DESeq2} those methods
are implemented using functions \code{\link[DESeq2]{DESeqDataSetFromMatrix}},  
\code{\link[DESeq2]{DESeq}} and \code{\link[DESeq2]{results}} with p-values ajusted for multiple 
testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (also called q-values), with the false discovery rate given in
input (argument \code{FDR}). 
For continuous anchoring data, the \code{lm} and \code{anova} functions are used 
to fit the model and compare it to the null model, and the pvalues are then corrected using
the function \code{p.adjust} with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

 \itemize{
\item The ANOVA_based test (\code{"ANOVA"}) is classically used for 
selection of omics data in the general case but it requires many replicates per dose
to be efficient, and is thus not really suited for a dose-response design.

\item The linear trend test (\code{"linear"}) aims at detecting monotonic trends from dose-response designs,
whatever the number of replicates per dose. 
As proposed by Tukey (1985), it tests the global significance of
a linear model describing the response as a function of the dose in rank-scale.

\item The quadratic trend test (\code{"quadratic"})  
tests the global significance of a quadratic model describing the response as a function of the dose in rank-scale.
It is a variant of the linear trend method that aims at detecting monotonic and non monotonic trends from a dose-response designs, whatever the number of replicates per dose (default chosen method).
 }
 
After the use of one this previously described tests, 
a filter based on the proportion of tied values is also performed whatever the type of data, assuming 
tied values correspond to a minimal common value at which non detections were imputed. 
All items having a proportion of such tied minimal values above the input argument
\code{max.ties.prop} are eliminated from the selection.
 
}

\value{ 
   \code{itemselect} returns an object of class \code{"itemselect"}, a list with 5 components:
    
  \item{ adjpvalue }{ the vector of the p-values adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method 
  (also called q-values) for selected items 
(adjpvalue inferior to FDR) sorted in ascending order}

  \item{ selectindex }{ the corresponding vector of row indices of selected items in the object omicdata }

  \item{omicdata}{The corresponding object of class \code{"microarraydata"},
  \code{"RNAseqdata"}, \code{"continuousomicdata"} or \code{"continuousanchoringdata"}
  given in input.}

  \item{select.method}{The selection method given in input.}

  \item{FDR}{The threshold in term of FDR given in input.}

  The print of a \code{"itemselect"} object gives the number of selected items and the 
  identifiers of the 20 most responsive items.
