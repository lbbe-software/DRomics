\title{Import and check of continuous omic data (e.g. metabolomic data)}

\description{
Metabolomic or other continuous omics data are imported from a .txt file 
(internally imported using the function \code{\link{read.table}})
and checked or from a R object of class \code{data.frame}
(see the description 
of argument \code{file} for the required format
of data). 
No normalization nor transformation is provided in this function.
The pretreatment of such continuous omic data data must be done before importation of data, 
and data must be imported in log scale if needed (imperative for example for metabolomic data),
so that they can be directly modelled using a normal 
error model. This strong hypothesis is required both for selection of items and for dose-reponse modelling.
As an example, a basic procedure for this pre-treatment of metabolomic data could follow
the three steps described thereafter:
i) removing of metabolites for which the proportion of missing data 
  (non detections) across all the samples is too high 
  (more than 20 to 50 percents according to your tolerance level);
ii) retrieving of missing values data using half minimum method 
  (i.e. half of the minimum value found for a metabolite across all samples);
iii) log-transformation of values.
If a scaling to the total intensity (normalization by sum of signals 
in each sample) or another normalization is necessary and pertinent, 
we recommend to do it before those three previously decribed steps.

\usage{
continuousomicdata(file, backgrounddose, check = TRUE)
metabolomicdata(file, backgrounddose, check = TRUE)

\method{print}{continuousomicdata}(x, \dots)
\method{plot}{continuousomicdata}(x, range4boxplot = 0, \dots)
}

\arguments{
\item{file}{The name of the .txt file (e.g. \code{"mydata.txt"})
containing one row per item, with the first column corresponding to the identifier of each item, 
and the other columns giving the responses
of the item for each replicate at each dose or concentration. 
In the first line, after a name for the identifier column, we must have the tested
doses or concentrations in a numeric format for the corresponding replicate 
(for example, if there are triplicates for each treatment, 
the first line could be "item", 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, etc.). 
This file is imported within the function using the function
\code{\link{read.table}} with its default field separator (sep argument)and 
its default decimal separator (dec argument at ".").
Alternatively an R object of class \code{data.frame} can be directly given in input, 
corresponding to the output
of \code{read.table(file, header = FALSE)} on a file described as above. The two
alternatives are illustrated below in examples.}


\item{backgrounddose}{This argument must be used when there is no dose at zero in the data, to prevent the calculation of the BMD by extrapolation. All doses below  or equal to the value given in backgrounddose will be fixed at 0, so as to be considered at the background level of exposition.}


\item{check}{If TRUE the format of the input file is checked.}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{"continuousomicdata"}.}

\item{range4boxplot}{An argument passed to boxplot(), fixed by default at 0 
  to prevent the producing of very large plot files due to many outliers. 
  Can be put at 1.5 to obtain more classical boxplots.}

\item{\dots}{ further arguments passed to print or plot functions.}
}

\details{
This function imports the data, checks their format  
(see the description 
of argument \code{file} for the required format
of data) and gives in the \code{print} information
that should help the user to check that the coding of data is correct : 
the tested doses (or concentrations), 
the number of replicates for each dose, the number of items and the identifiers 
of the first 20 items. 

\code{metabolomicdata()} is the first name we gave to this function. 
We renamed it \code{continuousomicdata} (while keeping the first name available) 
to offer its use to other
continuous omic data such as proteomics data or RT-QPCR data. Nevertheless
one should take care of the scale in which such data are imported in DRomics.
A transformation may be needed to enable the use of a normal error model 
in each step of the DRomics workflow (from selection of items to modelling and 
BMD calculation)
}

\value{ 
   \code{continuousomicdata()} returns an object of class "continuousomicdata", 
   a list with 7 components:
    \item{data}{ the numeric matrix of responses of each item in each replicate
  (one line per item, one column per replicate)  }

    \item{dose}{ the numeric vector of the tested doses or concentrations corresponding
    to each column of data}

    \item{item}{ the character vector of the identifiers of the items, corresponding to
    each line of data}

    \item{design}{ a table with the experimental design (tested doses and number of 
    replicates for each dose) for control by the user}

    \item{data.mean}{ the numeric matrix of mean responses of each item per dose (mean 
    of the corresponding replicates) (one line per item, one column per unique value 
    of the dose}
    
    \item{data.sd}{ the numeric matrix of standard deviations of the response of each 
   item per dose (sd of the corresponding replicates, NA if no replicate) 
   (one line per item, one column per unique value of the dose)}

    \item{containsNA}{ TRUE if the data set contains NA values}

  The print of a \code{continuousomicdata} object gives the tested doses (or concentrations) 
  and number of replicates for each dose, the number of items, the identifiers 
  of the first 20 items (for check of good coding of data) and the normalization method.
   The plot of a \code{continuousomicdata} object shows the data distribution for each dose or concentration and replicate.
